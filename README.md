Bp1 - Doctor House Hospital #1 (Hospital Admission, Diagnose Room)  The Hospital Admission is an app that receives Patients through the /patients endpoint. As soon as they arrive they get a patient number given and they are forwarded to the Diagnose Room. The Dr House will observe the Patientâ€™s symptoms and figure out his illness and if he is unsure, he will quickly estimate that it must be lupus. Later on, after the 4 Bps are concluded, the Dr House will forward the Patient with his right diagnosis to the Nursery.
